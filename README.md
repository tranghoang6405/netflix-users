# Netflix Users Database
## Overview
This project presents an analysis of a fictional Netflix users dataset, drawn from Kaggle. The dataset contains 25,000 randomly generated user records designed for analysis, visualization, and machine learning practice. Using Power BI, I have created insightful visualizations to explore user demographics, subscription preferences, and viewing behavior.

## Dataset Description
- Columns
- User_ID – Unique identifier for each user
- Name – Randomly generated name
- Age – Age of the user (13 to 80)
- Country – User’s country (randomly chosen from 10 options)
- Subscription_Type – Type of Netflix plan (Basic, Standard, Premium)
- Watch_Time_Hours – Total hours watched in the last month
- Favorite_Genre – User’s preferred genre
- Last_Login – Last recorded login date within the past year

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
Removed inconsistencies and missing values
Rounded the watch time values to improve readability
Created a new column for Age Distribution, categorizing users into:
- Children & Teenage
- Adults
- Seniors

## Power BI Visualization
1. Age Group Breakdown of Netflix Users – A pie chart categorizing users into Children & Teenage, Adults, and Seniors
2. Distribution of Favorite Genres – A donut chart showing users’ preferred Netflix genres
3. Subscription Types Across Countries – A bar chart visualizing the distribution of Basic, Standard, and Premium subscribers by country
4. Average Watch Time by Age – A scatter plot analyzing the relationship between user age and monthly watch hours
